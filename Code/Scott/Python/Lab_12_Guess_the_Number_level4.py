# This can be done by maintaining a variable containing the last guess outside the loop, then comparing
# the last guess to the current guess, and check if it's closer. Hint: you're interested in comparing the two absolute differences:
# abs(current_guess-target) and abs(last_guess-target).

#before Matt helped me I was trying to intially account for this within the loop. Was getting stuck in circles.

#The fist time through, the value of last_guess is updated from None to the value of current_guess (the fist guess), and that is all that happens. Then the loop is started again, a second guess is acquired
# and now we have two guesses to compare. And because the value of last_guess is no longer None, this section of the code is activated and the comparison is made.
