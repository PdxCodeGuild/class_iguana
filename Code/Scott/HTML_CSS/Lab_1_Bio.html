    <h1>G. K. (Gilbert Keith) Chesterton</h1>

    <h2>29 May 1874 - 14 June 1936</h2>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton"> G.K. Chesterton</a> was an English writer, poet,
        philosopher, dramatist, journalist, orator, lay theologian, biographer, and
        literary and art critic. Chesterton is well known for his fictional priest-detective Father Brown, and and for his
        reasoned
        apologetics. He wrote around 80 books, several hundred poems, some 200 short stories, 4000 essays, and several
        plays.</p>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="quote-font">"There is only one thing that it requires real courage to say, and that is a truism."</p>


    <p>In September 1895 Chesterton began working for the London publisher Redway, where he remained for just over a year.
        In October 1896 he moved to the publishing house T. Fisher Unwin, where he remained until 1902. During this period
        he also undertook
        his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902 the Daily News gave him a weekly
        opinion column,
        followed in 1905 by a weekly column in The Illustrated London News, for which he continued to write for the next
        thirty years.</p>

    <p>Early on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his
        writing shows a
        vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images. Even his fiction contained carefully concealed
        parables.
        Father Brown is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and
        wandering off
        at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story
        "The Flying Stars",
        Father Brown entreats the character Flambeau to give up his life of crime: "There is still youth and honour and
        humour in you; don't
        fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on
        one level of evil.
        That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it.
        Many a man I've known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into
        slime."</p>

        <p>Chesterton loved to debate, often engaging in friendly public disputes with such men as George Bernard Shaw, H.
            G. Wells,
            Bertrand Russell and Clarence Darrow. According to his autobiography, he and Shaw played cowboys in a silent
            film that was never released.</p>
