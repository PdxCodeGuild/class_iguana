         <P>We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. There are no limits in this world. Trees grow in all kinds of ways.
             They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here.
             Just use the old one inch brush. That's crazy. Do an almighty painting with us.</P>

            <p>Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.
                A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Look at them little rascals.</p>

            We can fix anything. You're meant to have fun in life. Let's build some happy little clouds up here.
            Imagination is the key to painting. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. I was blessed with a very steady hand;
             and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.
             Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.</P>

          <p>Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals.
              That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.</p>

           <p>You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. In your world you have total and absolute power.
               Just let these leaves jump off the brush Use what you see, don't plan it. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint.
               That's much harder. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look.</p>
