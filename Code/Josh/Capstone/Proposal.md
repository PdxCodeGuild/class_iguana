# Capstone Project Proposal
Create a webapplication that lets users sign up to be a user on the site and upon signing up the user will receive X ammount of credits (points or bucks the name is arrbitray). After the user has signed up they can use those credits to wager bets with one another or let the user wager bets against the house. These bets will be off of sports games (probably start with college basketball), the odds for the payouts as well as the scores for the games will be brought in through a web API. The user will have the option to have different bet bet peramitors such as a single team to win to satisfy a winning bet or having multiple teams need to win to satisfy a winning bet(parlay bet). the winning user will be paid out their credits after all bet peramitors have been satsfied.

## Name
The name I want to use comes from when I make bets with friends usually the person is confident about their bet would say to the other "Let's put some skin on it", which meant lets bet some money to see who'll win, so I would like to call my project: **Skin on it**
