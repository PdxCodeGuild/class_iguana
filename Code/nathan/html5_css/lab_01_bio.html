                Tom Nook, known in Japan as Tanukichi, is a fictional character in the
            Animal Crossing series who operates the village store. He first appears
            in the Nintendo 64 game D≈çbutsu no Mori, released in Europe and North America
            on the Nintendo GameCube as Animal Crossing. Nook sells a house to the player
            at the beginning of each title in the series, giving a set mortgage for them
                    to pay and offering to upgrade it after the mortgage is paid off.</p>

                <p>
                He has made several appearances in the Super Smash Bros. series as well.
            Nintendo's Treehouse localization members Rich Amtower and Reiko Ninomiya argued
            that, in spite of his perceived greed, he is a nice person due to taking the
                    risk of hiring someone who was new to the town.</p>

                <p>
                Tom Nook has received mixed reception since his appearance in Animal Crossing.
            IGN listed him as the ninth most-wanted character to appear in Super Smash Bros Brawl.
            They describe him as devious, diabolical, and sinister, commenting that while he
            may not be a good fighter due to being from a video game without any fighting,
                they would enjoy seeing him get beaten up.</p>
