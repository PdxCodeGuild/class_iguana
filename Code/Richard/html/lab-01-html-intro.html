			Moses (trad. ca. 1500 BCE) is a prophet of God recognized in the Abrahamic religions, notably Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Moses is credited with bringing the Ten Commandments to the Israelites and with leading them (in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus">Exodus</a>) from captivity in Egypt and into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promised_Land">Promised Land</a>. Authorship of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah">Torah</a>, the first five books of the Tanakh, the central text in Judaism, is traditionally attributed to Moses. Monotheism, the prohibition of idolatry, and many of the taboos and prescriptions surviving in the Abrahamic religions (notably Judaism and Islam) originate in what is known as Mosaic Law, which spans the first four books of the Torah.

			Contemporary scholarship outside these religious traditions considers Moses and the narratives surrounding him to be legendary rather than historic. There is, for example, no evidence that the Israelites were held captive (or ever lived) in Egypt, and modern sensibilities generate doubt surrounding miracles attributed to Moses such as the parting of the Red Sea.
