adventure.py, a simple game played in the terminal
A player encounters some other beings and interacts with them, with towns and forests.
The player seeks food by searching towns and forests and/or stealing from other beings.
The other beings can be helpful in finding food, and can pose dangers of their own.

For example, crocodiles are strong and fearless, while scholars are smart and dogs loyal. A smart, cute cat might help you find food in a town, and even a thief or a crocodile might help you find food in a dangerous forest. But crocs and thieves can be risky companions; you never know when they might turn on you. If you\'re not feeling cooperative, you can try to steal food from a would-be companion--but if they\'re stronger, they\'ll steal food from you out of spite. \n\nFirst, take a moment to find yourself in the landscape. You\'re the blue head-and-shoulders figure. A scholar is represented by a scroll, and a thief is a scary-looking figure. Dogs, cats and crocs look like dogs, cats and crocs.
